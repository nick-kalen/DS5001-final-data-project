report.pdf, report.ipynb, and report.html are my final report. 

ETA.ipynb was my notebook used to do the exploratory analysis and create the visualizations. The visualizations used in the report were created in this file, but stored in the `pictures` folder. The `helper_files` folder contains files used in this notebook, and the `source_files` contains the original text. Additionally, all of the primary tables used in this notebook are stores in the `tables` folder.

I collaborated with Rachel Grace Treene, Eve Schoenrock, and Connor Nickol on this project.
